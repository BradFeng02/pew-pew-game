attempt 2:
One day I was just on the internet when I heard about a game called Noita that just went into early access. I looked at the trailer and it blew my mind. They had a similar idea where every "block" is really small, but the key difference was that they had physics on each and every particle.
I was instantly hooked on that idea nd started researching it. I found some tech talks by the devs, and turns out they were using falling sand physics. This was like The Powder Toy, another game I played a ton when I was a kid.
Being overly ambitious, of course I had to try recreating what a professional game dev team did in several years.
For some reason, I also decided at the same time to learn some opengl. I wanted to move away from drawing pixels one by one in the framebuffer and start using shaders. At this point, using opengl made basically no difference.
Anyways, I just couldn't get the physics to feel right.
