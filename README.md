a 2d pixel game inspired by like Noita. I wanted to make a game, and also get myself to use c++ so i tried this. I wanted to build as much of it from scratch just to see what happens so thats why im not using unity or something.

current: master  
attempt 1: attempt-1 (branch readme has gifs)  
attempt 2: attemp-2 (branch readme has gifs)

This time i wanted to actually try to use opengl (barely). I spent most of my time playing with water because its fun
