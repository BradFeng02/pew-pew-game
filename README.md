attempt 1:
I discovered SDL and tried to use that. I stored my world in big vectors and drew everything using some paint pixel function. It was really slow.
Then I started directly accessing the framebuffer and putting pixels there. After rewriting some code because it was still slow, it ran at 60 fps which was my target.
I wrote some simple terrain generation too. I got as far as making explosions and bombs that make them (this part was fun).

recording these was really fun. I still really like how this little experiment turned out:
